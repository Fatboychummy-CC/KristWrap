# KristWrap
KristWrap is similar to tmpim's k.lua, but without the need to change your coding style to support jua.

# Warning:
**This definitely contains bugs! I don't have my normal pc and setting up a krist miner on this pc is somewhat out of the question. I cannot test further until I get back to my main PC or krist.ceriat.net comes back from its coma.**

# About
Like stated above, this is similar to k.lua, but you don't need to change your coding style. Initially, this project will purely be for transactions and etc. It may get larger later (or I may forget about it, who knows?), but for now I'm building it for [Simplify Shop V2](https://github.com/Fatboychummy-CC/Simplify-Shop-V2).
