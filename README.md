# KristWrap
KristWrap is similar to tmpim's k.lua, but without the need to change your coding style to support jua.

# Warning:
**This definitely contains bugs! I don't have my normal pc and setting up a krist miner on this pc is somewhat out of the question. I cannot test further until I get back to my main PC or krist.ceriat.net comes back from its coma.**
